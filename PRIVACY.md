# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

The Gemini Agent Browser Extension is designed with a "Local First" philosophy. We believe your browsing data belongs to you.

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: All chat history, recorded macros, and preferences are stored locally on your device using the `chrome.storage.local` API.
- **Data Clearing**: You can wipe all extension data at any time via the Options page.

## Data Transmission

- **AI Providers**: By default, the extension uses a "Mock Provider" which runs entirely locally and transmits no data.
- **External Providers**: If you configure an external AI provider (e.g., OpenAI API), the extension will send the prompts you generate (which may include page context) to that provider. This is subject to the privacy policy of the respective provider.

## Analytics

- This extension does **not** collect or transmit any usage analytics or telemetry to the developers.
